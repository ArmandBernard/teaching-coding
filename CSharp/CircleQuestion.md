# Purpose

This is a challenge to test your understanding of classes; `private` and `public`; properties; getters and setters.

# Challenge

Create a class called "Circle" with Methods "Perimeter" and "Area" that return those values.
In the constructor, you should provide any dimensions needed to calculate these.
These dimensions should be stored in "properties", and should not be set-able from the outside.
They should, however, be get-able from the outside.
