# Purpose

To help teach the benefits of LINQ.

# Order of tasks

From a learning perspective, the following is the best order:

- Exercise 1
- Teach LINQ
- Exercise 2 & 3

# Exercise 1

Create a function that takes an array of integers, and returns the number of items that are even inside the array.

e.g. `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => 2`

# Exercise 2

Do the same with LINQ

# Exercise 3

Make the function capable of taking both `Array` and `List`.
