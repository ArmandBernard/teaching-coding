# Purpose

To explain what scripts are and what they're used for.

# What are scripts?

Scripts allow you to change things dynamically in a webpage and transmit information to a server. Basically every website uses them.

# The web without scripts

While a lot can be done with static webpages, there are inherent limitations.

## Passing information to the server without scripts

One way to pass information back to the server is to create links in pages that bring the user to **specific urls** that contain information.

Think, for example, about YouTuber affiliate links.

They usually go something like www.company-name.com/youtuber-name. When you navigate to those links, you're telling the website where you've come from. They know where you are trying to navigate to.

To add to this, a website can provide can set **cookies** on a users browser. They can then look at those cookies later to determine who the person is, where they have come from etc, what links they have gone through etc.

Both of these things are valuable tools to a web developer, but they are limiting as the only source of interactivity.
