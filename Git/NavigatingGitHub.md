# Purpose

This file shows how to navigate GitHub. It sounds dumb, but to a complete beginner this may be helpful.

# Project Homepage

![Project Homepage](images/ProjectHomePageAnnotated.png)

The project home page will allow you to reach most other places, and it's most likely where you'll land when you get linked a project.

## The README

The [README.md](/README.md) file stored inside the root of the project will render directly on the home page.

This usually contains information on the project and how to use it.

## The Source (Project Files)

By "source" or "source code" we mean the files that developers use to develop and build a project.
Of course, it doesn't need to contain only code, but can contain images and documentation files.

This section of the GitHub interface is effectively a file browser, allowing you to navigate the folders and open files of the project.

Clicking folders will allow you to navigate around the file browser. Once you're out of the root folder, you will see what's known as "breadcrumbs" that will allow you to see how deep you are and navigate back up.

Clicking a file will bring you to a file [preview](#file-preview). If you are in a file preview, you will not see the file browser any more. You will still see the breadcrumbs to navigate back up.

## Downloading the Source

![Download Source](images/DownloadSource.png)

You can download all of the files in the project by pressing the green "Code" dropdown on the home page.

The most common mistake ever made on GitHub is thinking this is the same as the downloading the release of the program the project is for. Often people will go to GitHub to download a piece of software, not interested in the code behind the software, wanting the .exe, .dmg or similar.

For that, you likely want to go to the [Releases](#releases) page of a project.

## Releases

This part of the page contains a link to the Releases Page, if there are any releases for the project.

The Releases Page is where fully built, final copies of software are often distributed.

It will also contain Release Notes for each version released of the software, if the devs are doing their job properly.

# File Preview

Hey! That's where you are right now!

The file preview will render files that support it, and show you the code otherwise.

Clicking `<>` icon will give you the code for the page, rather than the render or preview.

You can also edit or delete a file directly here, but that is not usually recommended.

Apart from previewing, this page provides little purpose.
