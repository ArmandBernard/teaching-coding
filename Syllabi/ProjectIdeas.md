# Ideas

## Remote PC Monitoring

The idea here is to monitor PC performance remotely from a phone or another PC.

Prerequisites

- WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)
- ASP.NET Core
  - API Controller
  - Running jobs / services
- React
- npm
- SQL, JSON or csv

## Auto Cropper

(I've already done this)

Make a CLI program that can crop black borders from images for you.

- Console
- System.Windows.Media or System.Drawing
- File access

## Recipe Database

(I've already started, then partially abandoned this)

Write an app that will allow you to manage recipes.

- ASP.NET Core with API Controller
- React
- npm
- SQL via Entity Framework Core
- Light image manipulation

## Web Scrapper

Choose a website, then scrape information from it! Could also include public API access.
A basic UI could also be built.

- Console App
- HttpClient or similar
- Selenium or similar
- Perhaps a UI to display data
