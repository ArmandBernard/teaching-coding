# Purpose

This file details the syllabus of my teaching. It will be broken up into sections, subdivided into other, more detailed sections.

I expect not much detail will be there to start off with, and I will likely revise and add to it a lot.

# Syllabus

- How to use VS Code
  - [Download and install](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - General interface tour
  - [Useful extensions](VSCode/UsefulExtensions.md)
