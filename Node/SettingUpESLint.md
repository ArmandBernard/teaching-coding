# Purpose

Explain how to set up ESLint.

# Install ESLint

Install it with `npm i -D eslint`.

# Configuration

ESLint is heavily configurable. A good way to get some reasonable rules is to run the wizard using the following command:

`npm init @eslint/config`

It will ask you some questions about what you have in your project and how you like things.

At the end, it may also install some extra modules.

# VS Code extension

Also ensure you have installed the [ESLint VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) so that you don't see warnings only at runtime.
