# Purpose

This file outlines some useful VS Code Extensions you may need for various things. I will try to categorise them by usage

# Extensions

## General use

[Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph) - The actual best git graph. A necessity.

[Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) - Exactly what it sounds like. Seems to work across most programming languages and file formats pretty well.

[GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - Not necessary. I use it for interactive rebases.

[IntelliCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode) - Will make your suggestions better.

[Path Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ionutvmi.path-autocomplete) - Very handy if you want to make relative paths to other files a the project

[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - A code formatter JS devs can't live without. Will work with many languages, mostly around web development. Will wrap lines, clean things up. Remember to turn on Format on Save.

## HTML

[Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag) - Closes tags automatically in HTML or similar languages. It's enough of a basic feature I'm still not sure why its not on by default. Only install this if its not already a thing in VS Code, as it likely will eb at some point.

[Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag) - Usually used with the above, allows you to rename the closing tab alongside the opening one

## Javascript

[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - A code linter for JS.

## Markdown

[Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one) - If you're editing documentation like that covered in this project, this helps.
