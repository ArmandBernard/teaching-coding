# Purpose

To explain how to get a React project up and running.

# Options

There are many ways to run React.

You can run it with many different back-ends. However, you will usually need Node.js at some point in the process.

The main difference in how it will be **packaged**, **bundled** and **rendered**.

Rendering-wise, you can use Server-Side Rendering, partial hydration, or a front-end rendered Single Page Application.

Packaging-wise You can run React apps on the web, or as **desktop applications** using tools like React Native and Electron.

Bundling is the process of combining JavaScript libraries for a given webpage or application and shipping it out with HTML and CSS.
There are many popular tools for bundling including: Webpack, Vite and Rollup.

Do some research and find out which is best for your application!

# Guide for Vite

In this document, I'm going to detail how to set up a React application using Vite.

Why Vite? Well:

- Changes you make in code are immediately and quickly updated in the browser on file save using Hot Module Reload.
- It's very easy to set up as long as you are writing a Single Page Application.
- It works well with TypeScript
